Hi,

I'm Chris and Marq is my side project. Marq springs from a desire to get faster feedback in order to quickly validate ideas. Entrepreneurs know what I mean. At my startup [Consignd](http://www.consignd.com) we ceaselessly compare our assumptions with the actions and opinions of living people from all walks of life. Just because the questions we ask have no right answer or the right answer is very hard to come by does not mean that a good enough answer or even a dumb answer is not valuable to us. When dealing with ideas that involve people - opinions matter. So we talk to lots of people. We go to the street and the coffee shop. We make surveys. Generally our surveys suck. They're not fun or immediate and they tend to look like from the government or the College Board. Marq aims to subvert surveys by making them suck a little less.
