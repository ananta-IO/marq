				<p>Hi,</p>
				<p>Iâ€™m Christopher, and Marq is my side project. Marq springs from a desire to <strong>get fast feedback in order to quickly <a src="http://theleanstartup.com/" title="lean startup" target="_blank">validate ideas</a></strong>.<p>
				<p>Entrepreneurs know what I mean, and I believe that everyone intuitively understands the problem of making judgments about the world with limited and incomplete information. At <a href="http://www.consignd.com" title="Consind - reinventing the middle man" target="_blank">Consignd</a> my co-founders and I try to compare our assumptions with the actions and opinions of people from all walks of life. Just because the questions we ask have no right answer, or the right answer is very hard to come by, does not mean that a good enough answer, or even a dumb answer, is not valuable to us. When dealing with ideas that involve people - <em>opinions matter</em>. So we talk to lots of people. We go to the street and the coffee shop. We make prototypes and show them to strangers. And throughout all of this experimentation we make surveys.</p>
				<p>Generally our surveys suck. They're not fun or immediate and they tend to look like something from the government or the College Board. <strong>Marq aims to make surveys fun</strong>, so you can see meaningful results quickly, and move on to the important business of realizing the right idea.</p>
				<p>The goal is to make it fun to not just answer questions, but to ask questions and explore results too. <strong>All questions are constrained to 140 characters with a maximum of 5 possible responses</strong>. These limitations are by design, with the hope that <strong>questions are catalysts for much larger discussions</strong>.</p> 
				<p>If you have a suggestion pose it in the form of question and <a href="/questions/new">ask it</a>. And if you really want to get your hands dirty submit an <a href="https://github.com/ananta-IO/marq/issues" title="marq issues" target="_blank">issue</a>, or better yet, some code. <a href="https://github.com/ananta-IO/marq" title="github repo" target="_blank">The project</a> is open source, and would not exist without great tools like <a href="http://meteor.com/" title="Meteor JS" target="_blank">Meteor</a>, <a href="http://telesc.pe/" title="Telescope" target="_blank">Telescope</a>, <a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/" title="Twitter Bootstrap" target="_blank">Twitter Bootstrap</a>, and <a href="http://coffeescript.org/" title="Coffeescript" target="_blank">Coffeescript</a>. Thank you, and I hope you have fun.</p>
